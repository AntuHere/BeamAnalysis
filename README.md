# 🔧 Structural Engineering in Action: Beam Analysis (Version 1) 🔧

Understanding the behavior of beams under loads is essential for safe and efficient structural design. In this analysis, I visualized the **bending moment diagram** for a beam subjected to point loads and a uniformly distributed load (UDL).

## 📊 Key Insights:

- The plot illustrates **positive** and **negative bending moments** along the beam's length.
- Positive moments are represented by the **blue shaded region**, while negative moments are shown in **red**.
- This diagram helps engineers determine the **stress distribution** and evaluate the performance of structural elements under load.

## 💡 Why It Matters:

- **Bending moment diagrams** are crucial in designing beams and ensuring they can withstand applied loads without failure.
- This tool is part of the fundamental analysis process in **structural engineering**, ensuring the safety and efficiency of construction projects.

## 🛠 Tools Used:

- **Python** for modeling and calculation
- **NumPy** for efficient data handling and numerical calculations
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing the bending moment diagram


## ⚙️ Features:

- **Interactive Plot**: Displays the bending moment diagram for a beam with multiple loads, including point loads and uniformly distributed loads (UDL).
- **Positive and Negative Moment Visualization**: Positive and negative bending moments are clearly visualized with shaded areas in **blue** and **red**, respectively.
- **Real-time Calculation**: The program computes the bending moment at any point along the beam, considering the applied loads.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Users can modify the beam length, load positions, magnitudes, and type of load to analyze different beam configurations.
- **Clear Legends and Axis Labels**: The plot includes informative legends, axis labels, and a grid for easy interpretation of results.
- **Scalable for Larger Projects**: This tool can be extended for more complex structural analysis, such as multi-span beams or varying load types.
